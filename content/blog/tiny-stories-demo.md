### Tbilisi AI Lab Announces Breakthrough in Georgian Generative AI - A Step Towards Linguistic Inclusivity in AI

As 2023 witnesses a surge in generative AI research and the influx of investments in this domain, Tbilisi AI Lab is proud to announce a pioneering breakthrough in integrating the Georgian language into the fabric of generative AI. This milestone will be celebrated at a special event on 26th December at Stamba Hotel, Tbilisi, at 7 PM.

While American and European companies, such as OpenAI, Microsoft, and French startup Mistral, have been leading the generative AI revolution, their focus has primarily been on the English language. This is due to the abundance of English-language data on the internet, which forms the backbone of these AI models. However, this has inadvertently sidelined other languages, particularly those with rich histories and unique scripts like Georgian.

Tbilisi AI Lab, founded by entrepreneurs who recently achieved success with their AI startup, is addressing this gap. Our team is dedicated to developing native Georgian large language models, which promise to revolutionize the way Georgian-speaking communities interact with technology. Our goal is to provide intelligent services for education, customer service, and to boost overall productivity in Georgia.

Despite being in the research phase for only a few months, our team has made significant progress. We envision these advancements not only benefiting the Georgian-speaking population with intelligent conversational agents comparable to those available in English but also aiding other nations with low-resource languages similar to Georgian.

As Georgia edges closer to EU membership, opportunities for research labs like Tbilisi AI Lab expand, potentially leading to better access to EU grant programs and collaborations. This event marks not only a celebration of our progress but also a call to action for further support and collaboration in our journey towards linguistic inclusivity in AI.

We invite members of the press, technology enthusiasts, and stakeholders in the AI community to join us in this celebration and discussion about the future of AI in Georgia and beyond.
